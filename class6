Step1: Change PasswordAuthentication to yes in /etc/ssh/sshd_config
sudo service sshd restart

Step2: sudo adduser devops

Step3: sudo vi /etc/sudoers and give Sudo permission to devops
devops   ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL

Step4: Login by devops user to master/nodes

Step4: Install ansible on master by devops user
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install software-properties-common
$ sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
$ sudo apt install ansible

Step:5 
ssh-keygen(On Master)
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <user-id>@<x-host(slave-host-name) #These commands needs to run on Master


ansible -i /etc/ansible/hosts -m command -a "uptime" all
ansible-playbook -i /etc/ansible/hosts nginx_install.yml

Suppose,

1) I want to know the time since when server is up.

2) I want to know the hostname of server


I want install nginx software in all machine

YAML code:
=========
---
- hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: ensure nginx is at the latest version
      apt: name=nginx state=latest update_cache=yes

    - name: start nginx
      service:
          name: nginx
          state: started


Colour codding:

Green> No change all good
Red> Failed
Yellow> Changes are done
white> simple linux things



Ansible is tool under the categary of configuration management. with the help of ansible you can create/delete/update/retrive the infomation.

In ansible you can either run command or run YAML file.

1) When you are running commands, it is known as adhoc commands
2) When you are running set of instruction in YAML formate is known as playbook.


How to run adhoc command
Ansible -i[inverntory] location_of_inverntory -m[module] -a[agrumemt] [name_of_servergroup]
ansible -i /etc/ansible/hosts -m command -a "uptime" UMESH

How many modules Ansible supports? around 500+



docker build -t image1 dockerfile

- name: Build image and with build args
  docker_image:
    name: image1
    build:
      path: .
      args:
    source: build


YAML: YAML is formate to represent data. it support all the lanugage fundamental concept like ifelse, loops....

Monitoring:
===========
> In monitoring we monitor in and our everything.

> Monitoring is way to prevent failure

> In hospital doctor monitors health stats.

1) Log forwarding: in this stage we are forarding log to master server
Master slave > central server and indivisual server

For this all the monitoring tool are having some supporting tool
like Splunk> splunk forwarder
        ELK> Beat

ubuntu $ touch server1.log.txt
ubuntu $ touch server2.log.txt
ubuntu $ touch server3.log.txt
ubuntu $ vi server1.log.txt
ubuntu $ vi server2.log.txt
ubuntu $ vi server3.log.txt
ubuntu $ grep -r fine
server3.log.txt:server is working fine
server1.log.txt:Server is working fine
ubuntu $ grep -r issue
ubuntu $ cat server2.log.txt
Issue to start server
ubuntu $ grep -r Issue
server2.log.txt:Issue to start server



2) Query the data as per need[log filtering]

3) Visualization

Ron	75	67	54    failed
Olu	85	79	93    pass
Rajesh	87	99	98    pass      topper
Alex	40	50	77    failed
Javed	76	67	54    failed
Sandra	59	89	88    failed
Juhi	78	89	88    pass

Lets say passing criteria is marks should be greater then 70

How many student are pass > 4

who is topper> who is is pass and having highest marks

All the monitoring tool support query language.


Coloured Visulaization
======================
Red : Alert or failed
Green : All good
Yellow : Unstable


Notification mechanism:
======================
Here, you need to just send the data
