Cloud
-----

Cloud: https://myawsbucketfordevopswork.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Cloud+Essentials.zip

When we want to work in IT industry we require couple of resources. those resources are primarily categrized into following catagary

1) Compute
2) Storage
3) Networking
4) Database.

Generally, to get all these resources we need to follow process, and we need to pay money.

In earlier day's we were/are having concept of traditinal infrastucture where we purchase the resource that we need.[Baremetal] 

Capex:
Opex:[Monthly basis, pay per use]

But cloud comeup with a concept where you need to pay for Opex only. No capical expendeture needed.

Proven case study: Using cloud can save upto 75% of your cost.

Devops: Devops is Improvement.

What is relationship between devops and cloud
==============================================
Cloud is a subset of Devops.


Terraform
=========
Suppose, I want to create 1 linux terminal with 8GB RAM, and 100GB HDD.

Traditional way: I will raise one precurement ticket for 8GB RAM, and 100GB HDD. This ticket needs approval from finance team, business team and project management team.

Cloud way: Pre approval is given to resource.

What is Terraform?
Terraform is a way to speak with cloud to get resource configured.

Example: I want to create 1 linux terminal with 8GB RAM, and 100GB HDD.

Insalling terraform
===================
Link: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads

root@ip-172-31-26-36:~# terraform --version
Terraform v1.6.2
on linux_amd64

I want to create server with the help of terraform
==================================================
1) IAM[Identity and access management]: Here, I will be creating user, and that user would be having permission to create/delete/update/retrieve the resource.


Access key and secrate key
--------------------------
Access key and secrate key are working as userid and password

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAWGJPQBMN4CATBW7N
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=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

Terraform is a tool by which we can control our infrastucture in cloud.

Terraform init: It initialize communication between terraform and cloud provider
terraform apply: It apply configuration written in main.tf file
terraform destroy: It delete configuration written in main.tf file

What is main.tf file
=====================
Terraform provider: 3500+ [Link: https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers]

It is the configuration that we need to use.

How to write main.tf file
==========================
For writing main.tf file we must need knowledge of cloud.

Click on provider, the click on use provider tab

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "5.22.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  # Configuration options
}

Configuration options
=====================
In configuration option we specify what we need. 
Example: My requirment is I want to create EC2 instance.[AWS instance]

https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/instance

Why we need terraform
=====================
Suppose, I have my infrastucture running on in traditinal[or baremetal], now I need to move my infracture to cloud. So, I would be following the stangler pattern

80% load[tradional]  > 20% [cloud]
60% load[tradional]  > 40% [cloud]
40% load[tradional]  > 60% [cloud]
20% load[tradional]  > 80% [cloud]
00% load[tradional]  > 100% [cloud]

Multicloud architecture:
=======================
All the clouds are equally good, but they have expertise like

Google cloud: Storage
IBM cloud: reasearch
Azure: Windows
Oracle cloud: Network and Database

How terraform is saving cost?
=============================
Suppose, I am working for US railway.[6 AM to 9 PM]

I want server to started by 6AM
       server to terminated by 9PM


I am working on organization where they have

Dev
Test
Preprod
prod
DR

Earlier these environment running 24*7, now with the help of terraform I am able to use them effectively.

Inftrastucture management by terraform
======================================
I want to change from 1GB RAM to 8 GB ram

t2.micro
t2.large
